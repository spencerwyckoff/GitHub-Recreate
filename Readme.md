This was my first attempt at using Neat as a foundation for spacing out my CSS.  It was useful, but I think I could do somethings better next time.  

I also focused on creating more variables and mixins in Sass to shorten my CSS code length from last time (from over 1000lines to ~600)... There are still plenty of improvements I can make in this category and will continue to be a student.  Overall, my workflow for both the HTML and CSS sides has dramatically improved as well as my commits to Git.  

I also used JS and Underscore.JS to pull actual data from the GitHub API and created a Underscore template in my HTML to push that data into it.  Because I had already formatted my HTML and CSS, once it was mapped, there was very little extra styling to be done.
